# Kubeflow Central Dashboard

Kubeflow landing page. It provides following functionality:

* Web UI to access all Kubeflow components
* User registration flowA

## Implementation Details

The component has the following directory structure:

```text
./
├── deployment_patch.yaml               # Kustomize patch that adds extra env vars for pod
├── hub-component.yaml                  # Parameters definitions
├── kustomization.yaml.template         # Kustomize file for ths component
├── links-config.json                   # Configuration for splash screen
├── params.env.template                 # Configuration for environment variables of a central-dashboard pod
├── params.yaml                         # Config for Kustomize varibles
├── pre-deploy                          # Script to download tarball from kubeflow distribution website
├── pre-undeploy -> pre-deploy
├── clusterrole-binding.yaml.template   # RBAC for cluster role bindings
└── role-binding.yaml.template          # RBAC for role bindings
```

The component uses an offical Kubeflow distribution Kustomize [scripts]("https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/") as a and applies patches and additiona resources described in [kustomize.yaml](kustomize.yaml.template) file.

Where [pre-deploy](pre-deploy) script has been responsible for download tarball from Kubeflow official distribution website.

This component contains a special parameters to enable image pull from private docker registry

By default in the Kubeflow user id has been a valid email address. This is not the case for Intel, where user id is an `IDSID` parameter (from LDAP) which is not an email address. To allow this, we had to relax a user field validation in Add Contributor UI screen
